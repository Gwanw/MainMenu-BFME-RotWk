# MainMenu BFME RotWk

For an implementation of this menu a basic knowlegde about modding for bfme is required.

To use this apt, you have to download Feliwirs APT Converter:
https://github.com/feliwir/AptConverter
With this converter you can convert the xml into their binary game files (apt/const) and vice versa.

All files have to be packed as an big archive, so the game can use the files.
Since the map for the background is not included, it is recommended to download an background image like a map of middle earth.

The menu itself is not finished, only the single player nav and its submenu is finished. A cloud/smoke effect for the background is included aswell.
